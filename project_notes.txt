		- event word is present but no time. (5)
		- time is present but not relevant to the above 5 categories (10)
			- eg.: historic events from wikipedia
		- no events(25)
	- with events(60%)
		- past/future events of the above 5 categories.(60)

- Modules
	- Bag of words approach
		- Pattern matching using regex 
			- eg: starts at .* \d+:\d+(am|pm)
	- Tokenization
	- Spell correction
		- Explore spell correction in nltk
	- POS Tagger
		- temporal tagging and pos
	- Syntactic pattern(remove events in past tense)
	- Synonymy for 5 events
	- Named entity recognition
- Workflow
	- Perform tokenization, syntactic and then semantic.
	- List the event iff a date/time is present and is one of the above 5 events.
		- optional: location(NER)

- Report
